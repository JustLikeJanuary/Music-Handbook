/* Handbook for outlining keys
 Things to add:
  -Notes in key
  -About each key: mood, song examples, etc.
  -Chord generator
  -Back button
  -About each chord: function, what it usually replaces, moods created
  
Questions:
  Should each note be a single .html or make it all in the code?
  Should the circle of fifths be on the homepage?
